Got beta keys to give away? This is a very basic discord bot that does... well, just that.

1. Set up your config.ts (remove the .example)
2. don't forget to npm install and install mongodb
3. ts-node bot.ts (or npm start)
4. Take a .txt file with the keys on each line, and send it as a DM to the bot.
6. Then wala. You can do /key and it will get a new key for someone.
